    1	"Pilot"	 January 20, 2008
    </p>	
    <p id='plot'>
        Walter White, a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher facing a midlife crisis, finds out he has Stage 3, inoperable lung cancer. After riding along with his brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schraeder, on a raid of a methamphetamine lab, Walt realizes he can use his knowledge of chemistry to cook meth and make enough to support his family after he dies. Walt tracks down a former student-turned-meth cook/dealer, Jesse Pinkman, whose lab the DEA has raided, and enlists his help; they begin cooking in Jesse's RV. When Jesse tries to sell the meth they made, the dealers, one of whom, Emilio, is his ex-partner who got busted by the DEA, snatch him and make him show them the lab. Walt, knowing the dealers intend to kill them after learning his recipe, poisons them with phosphine gas.

    2	"Cat's in the Bag..." January 27, 2008	
    </p>
    <p id='plot'>
        Walt and Jesse try to dispose of the two bodies in the RV, which becomes increasingly complicated when one of them, Krazy-8, wakes up. They eventually imprison him in Jesse's basement. Meanwhile, Skyler grows suspicious of Walter's recent behavior, and they learn that they're expecting a daughter. She asks him about Jesse, whom she discovers after he calls Walt at their home, and Walt covers by telling her that Jesse sells him marijuana. Jesse disposes of Emilio's body using hydrofluoric acid as Walt instructs, but he ignores Walt's warning to use a plastic bin and uses his bathtub instead, resulting in a heavy clean-up when the acid eats through the floor below.

        3   "...And the Bag's in the River"	February 10, 2008
    </p>
    <p id='plot'>
        Walt cannot decide whether to kill Krazy-8 or release him. Meanwhile, Marie believes that Walter Jr. is smoking marijuana and asks Hank to scare him straight. Walt brings Krazy-8 food, but he collapses while descending the basement stairs. When he wakes up, he tells Krazy-8 that he has lung cancer--the first person he tells--and they start sharing the unexpected things they have in common. Walt eventually decides to release Krazy-8, but while disposing of the shards of a broken plate he sees that a shard is missing, and realizes that Krazy-8 has concealed it to use as a weapon. When Walt confronts Krazy-8 with this information, Krazy-8 attacks him, and Walt strangles his prisoner with the bicycle lock restraint. That night, Walter tells Skyler that he has something to tell her, and, off-camera, reveals his cancer diagnosis.

    </p>
    <p id='plot'>
        Walt and Jesse come to an agreement in which Walt will cook the meth while Jesse sells it. Jesse soon discovers Walt's motivation for their collaboration. Meanwhile, Hank ties a recovered respirator to Walt's high school's chemistry lab and investigates further. After discovering the start of hair loss, Walt shaves his head. Skyler has a baby shower at which Marie gives her a diamond tiara for the baby. When their initial batch of meth only yields $2,600, Walt demands that Jesse find a new distributor, so they can sell on a larger scale and make more money. Jesse gets connected to Tuco, the drug dealer who replaced Krazy-8, but when Jesse goes to make a deal, Tuco severely beats him and steals the meth. Walt then visits, causes an explosion in Tuco's hideout, and gets their money; Tuco decides to deal with Walt.

    </p>
    <p id='plot'>
        Walt and Jesse face difficulties producing the large amount of meth Walt has promised to Tuco. Skyler decides to return the tiara given to her by Marie, only to be detained at the store and informed that it had been stolen; when she confronts Marie, Marie flatly denies stealing it. Walt and Jesse break into a warehouse and steal a large barrel of methylamine, which they need for a new recipe that produces much more meth in much less time. They deliver the promised amount to Tuco and his associates, No-Doze and Gonzo; when No-Doze makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes enraged and savagely beats him.
